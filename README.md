This project presents a deep learning approach to classify financial sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) from unstructured text sources such as news headlines, analyst reports, and social media content. The model leverages Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and an Attention Mechanism to enhance contextual understanding and focus on sentiment-rich words.

ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights - 
Text Sources: Financial news, analyst reports, Twitter headlines

Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, padding, label encoding

Model: BiLSTM with Attention, Dropout, Batch Normalization

Training: Adam optimizer, EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools
Python, TensorFlow, Keras

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn


âœ… Outcomes - 
Accurate multi-class sentiment classification

Practical for investment analysis, risk assessment, and market trend insights

Demonstrates the application of deep learning and NLP in finance
